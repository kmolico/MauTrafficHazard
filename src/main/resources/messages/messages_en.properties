home.para1.bold=MauHazard 
home.para1.text=is an interactive tool to assess the Hazard Perception Skills of drivers in Mauritius. The number of road accidents on the island is increasing and this application will provide a means for training drivers to better perceive and react to potential hazardous situations, thereby reducing the likelihood of road accidents.
home.para2.bold=What is Hazard Perception? 
home.para2.text=Hazard perception has been described as the ability of drivers to read and anticipate potentially dangerous road situations, or hazards. This implies that hazard perception is not the occurrence of sudden hazards and taking action to avoid the crash at the last moment but rather to perceive hazard which is brought about by the action of another road user and which could materialize into a real hazard, forcing the driver to take evasive action (e.g. slow down, stop or swerve out of the way). Research suggests that hazard perception training helps improve Hazard perception skills and therefore contributes towards reducing accident liability (McKenna et al 1994).
home.para3.bold=What is Hazard Perception Test?
home.para3.text=The hazard perception test is an assessment that evaluates a person\u2019s ability to identify and respond to potentially dangerous road situations and to react appropriately. In particular, perception in driving terms can be defined as the art of being able to pick out the important details to enable a driver to anticipate what is likely to happen next with regards to a developing hazardous situation and a perceptive driver must look for alternatives to avoid any unfortunate event.

tutorial.title=Hazard Perception tutorial
tutorial.info.line.1=This tutorial has three clips, each with one developing hazard.
tutorial.info.line.2=Tap or click the video when you feel you are encountering a developing hazard. This is something that would cause you to take some form of action, such as changing speed or direction. A red flag will appear at the bottom of the screen to show your response.
tutorial.info.line.3=You will score five points for each developing hazard. The earlier you recognise and respond to the hazard, the more points you will receive.
