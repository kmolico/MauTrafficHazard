home.para1.bold=MauHazard 
home.para1.text=is an interactive tool to assess the Hazard Perception Skills of drivers in Mauritius. The number of road accidents on the island is increasing and this application will provide a means for training drivers to better perceive and react to potential hazardous situations, thereby reducing the likelihood of road accidents.
home.para2.bold=What is Hazard Perception? 
home.para2.text=Hazard perception has been described as the ability of drivers to read and anticipate potentially dangerous road situations, or hazards. This implies that hazard perception is not the occurrence of sudden hazards and taking action to avoid the crash at the last moment but rather to perceive hazard which is brought about by the action of another road user and which could materialize into a real hazard, forcing the driver to take evasive action (e.g. slow down, stop or swerve out of the way). Research suggests that hazard perception training helps improve Hazard perception skills and therefore contributes towards reducing accident liability (McKenna et al 1994).
